You step cautiously into the storage room, the dim glow of emergency lights casting eerie shadows on the stacks of crates and barrels. The air is thick with the smell of dust and oil. Your footsteps echo softly as you navigate the narrow aisles between the cargo.

Suddenly, you notice movement ahead. A pirate, rugged and scarred, is rifling through the storage. The moment he sees you, his eyes narrow and he straightens up, hand reaching for his weapon.

With a sneer, he steps forward, ready to attack. The room feels smaller, the walls closing in as the tension mounts. It's a fight or flight moment, and you must decide quickly how to handle this unexpected threat.
