Copilot: 
We were cruising normally when suddenly there was a massive jolt. The lights flickered, and alarms started blaring. 
I was thrown across the room and hit my head. After that, everything went dark. 
Afterwards, I found myself here. It could have been an external force, like an asteroid impact or a malfunction in the ships systems. 
We need to check the engine room to find out more. Whatever it was, it was strong enough to knock out our systems.
