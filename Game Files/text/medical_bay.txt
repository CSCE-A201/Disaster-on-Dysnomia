The Medical Bay is filled with various medical equipment. Cabinets line one wall, potentially holding various medical supplies. An office desk sits in the corner, cluttered with papers and small tools. Several pieces of equipment are scattered around, their screens dark and in poor condition. The dim lighting casts long shadows, making the room feel eerie and quiet. You may need to navigate this area to find supplies.
